Very simple to run:
1- Go in project directory
2- "cd /back/" then "npm install" then "npm start" (WILL RUN ON PORT 3000 DO NOT MODIFY)
3- Open new terminal
4- "cd /front/" then "npm install" then "npm start" (WILL SAY 3000 IS OCCUPIED AND ASK FOR RUNNING ON 3001 INSTEAD, ACCEPT 3001 AND DO NOT MODIFY 3001)
5- profit.
